###README file for Second Discussion Section

1. How much work is being done in main.lua?
  main.lua currently acts as the central hub of the projectâ€”it initializes the window, loads assets, stores the global game state, runs the main update, and draws loops. 
  
2. How encapsulated are the different part of the code?
  I will say the encapsulation is just okay for the different parts of the code.
  
3. Is the code easy to follow? (Maybe get an outside opinion for that one)

4. How could you improve any of these issues?

5. What patterns are currently being used and which ones could be used (and why)?
